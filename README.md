## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install *Laravel Breeze* using Composer.

```bash
composer require zacksmash/breeze-uikit
```

Next, you'll need to run the install command:

```bash
php artisan breeze:uikit
```

This command will publish **BreezeUIkits's** views and resources to your project.

- All `auth` views
- a `webpack.mix.js` file, tuned for UIkit
- a `package.json` file, for required NPM modules
- a slightly opinionated `.editorconfig` file
- a `.gitignore` file
- a new route for `user/profile`
